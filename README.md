# WhisperNode.com website

## Development
- `npm install gulp -g`
- `gulp`
- You now have the website running locally.
- Whenever you change a file in the `app` directory and save it, the local version will update and you can see your change.
- **Do not edit files in the `build` directory. Those files are generated by gulp and will be overwriten by the files in `app` when gulp is run.**

### How to add a new network
- Copy a file from `app/parts/networks`
- Update it with data for the new chain
- Copy/Paste a new `if` block section to the [app/js/common.js](https://github.com/WhisperNode/WhisperNode/blob/master/app/js/common.js#L1277)
